It does so by creating a space, both mental and physical, where all these stakeholders in the education of our future can open up and understand each other. This has the potential to work wonderfully to address many complicated questions concerning this issue in collaboration with others. It also serves as a forum for sharing the natural curiosity that springs from deep inside. Personalities keep developing in the right direction even as on the surface it all seems a matter of play.
